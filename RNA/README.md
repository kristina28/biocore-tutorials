### star-summary.py

This script summarizes the final.out logs from all the samples in a STAR alignment workflow, and takes as a positional argument the directory in which those log files can be found. It outputs two different PNG files: the first shows the number of reads in each mapping category for each sample, while the second shows the different types of error rates for each sample.
